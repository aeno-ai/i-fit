        <h2>What is a Calorie Surplus?</h2>
        <p>A calorie surplus occurs when you consume more calories than your body burns. This excess energy is often stored in the body as fat or used to build muscle, depending on factors like diet, exercise, and genetics. A calorie surplus is essential for those looking to gain weight, build muscle, or improve athletic performance.</p>

        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>Your body requires a certain number of calories to perform daily functions and physical activities. When you provide more energy (calories) than it needs, the surplus can support muscle growth when combined with strength training or lead to fat gain if not managed properly.</p>

        <h2>Why Consider a Calorie Surplus?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Muscle Building:</strong> A calorie surplus provides the extra energy required to repair and grow muscle tissue after workouts.</li>
            <li><strong>Healthy Weight Gain:</strong> For individuals underweight or struggling to maintain weight, a surplus can help achieve a healthier body composition.</li>
            <li><strong>Increased Energy Levels:</strong> Consuming more calories can help fuel demanding physical activity and support recovery.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips for a Healthy Calorie Surplus</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Focus on Nutrient-Dense Foods:</strong> Prioritize whole foods rich in vitamins, minerals, protein, and healthy fats.</li>
            <li><strong>Gradual Increase:</strong> Start by adding 250-500 calories to your daily intake to avoid excessive fat gain.</li>
            <li><strong>Combine with Strength Training:</strong> Resistance exercises can help ensure that the extra calories contribute to muscle gain rather than fat accumulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Adequate hydration is essential for optimal digestion and nutrient absorption.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Potential Downsides of a Calorie Surplus</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fat Gain:</strong> Without proper exercise and monitoring, excess calories may lead to unwanted fat accumulation.</li>
            <li><strong>Digestive Discomfort:</strong> Rapidly increasing calorie intake can sometimes lead to bloating or stomach upset.</li>
            <li><strong>Requires Monitoring:</strong> Tracking calorie intake and progress can be time-consuming but is important for avoiding excessive weight gain.</li>
        </ul>
